It all started because I wanted to learn Python.  The University I attend is a bit lacking in pythonistas,
so I had to take matters into my own hands.  However, I wasn't sure which route to take.  I tried going
through python problem sets on HackerRank, but these felt a little dry and I didn't feel the concepts
sinking in.  I thought about trying pycharm's educational version, but I soon found out this was for
someone completely new to programming and I soon lost interest.  I needed to rethink my strategy.  I had
just finished my software engineering course where I got well acquainted with GitHub and loved it.  And
then it struck me: I should just contribute to an open source project written in Python!  And so begins
my story into the world of open source software.

*To be continued!*
