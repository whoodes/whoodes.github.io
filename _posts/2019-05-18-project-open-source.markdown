It all started because I wanted to learn Python.  The University I attend is a bit lacking in pythonistas,
so I had to take matters into my own hands.  However, I wasn't sure which route to take.  I tried going
through python problem sets on HackerRank, but these felt a little dry and I didn't feel the concepts
sinking in.  I thought about trying pycharm's educational version, but I soon found out this was for
someone completely new to programming and I soon lost interest.  I needed to rethink my strategy.  I had
just finished my software engineering course where I got well acquainted with GitHub and loved it.  And
then it struck me: I should just contribute to an open source project written in Python!  And so begins
my story into the world of open source software.

Now that I was ready to embark on my epic journey, I just needed to find a place to start.  Which was a
bit overwhelming:  Which projects are good for beginners?  Am I going to be able to easily set up the
development environment?  Do I even have the necessary skills?  I mean I'm trying to learn a language
by contributing to a project? Am I crazy for even thinking this?  My mind was flooded with all of these
questions, questions sprinkled with just a touch of self-doubt.  But I wasn't going to let that stop me.
I've been in those types of places before, and I've always found that keeping my head down, pushing
forward, and working hard generates a large area on the probability distribution of success.  So, I
opened up Chrome, started up that shiny V8 javascript engine, typed, "good github projects for
beginners", and hit enter (actually return cause I'm using a mac)...

*To be continued...*
