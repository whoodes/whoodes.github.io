## The problem
Lost in the Canadian back country.  The butch plane, transporting you to a remote cabin hideout in the Saskatchewan province,
has just crashed near Lake Athabasca.  You awake dazed and confused next to a burning fuselage with scattered remnants of
what use to be your supplies, and pilot...  Coming to your senses, panic sets in at the realization that there is no hope of a
rescue party ever reaching you.  Frantic attempts to check for any means of contacting the outside world are fruitless: All
radios are destroyed, the satellite phone annihilated.  The only surviving hardware is your trusty laptop.  You breathe a sigh
of relief as you haven't pushed your local repo to origin for a while.  After collecting yourself, and what little supplies
are to be found, you head into the unknown.

## The light at the end of the tunnel
Night begins to fall, the chill from the howling sub-arctic winds slice through your Patagonia, straight to your bones.  But
alas, the falling sun gives evidence of electric light teeming just beyond the horizon.  Your spirits are re-kindled with hope
of civilization much closer than expected.  To your utter surprise, you stumble into a Marriott! Picking your jaw up off the
floor, you ask a fellow human, "but... what the... how...?  What is going on?"  The response, "Oh, yeah, people crash here all
the time, so they just decided to build a hotel."

## The solution
For me, the start of a project sometimes feels like being lost in the wilderness.  That was before I
learned about design patterns.  Often times, an approach to solving a problem can result in that particular approach
being a type of solution in and of itself.  Progress is typically made through the tedious and time consuming methodology of
trial and error.  When attempting to learn physics, the correct approach would not to be to first come up with a way to find
an instantaneous rate of change.  Some wig-wearing legend has already designed the solution to such a problem!  The same idea
applies to problems inherent in building large-scale software applications, don't try to reinvent the wheel!  Instead,
classify the application into a design best suited to the environment in which the software is going to be built.
