 This is a summary of a project that consisted of building a website for Gregory Hunter's business, Dynamic Water and 
Power Solutions LLC.  This project presented new and exciting challenges, as usual these challenges began as questions. 
Questions such as: Through what means would the page be hosted? AWS' S3 bucket could be the right solution; or maybe 
Digital Ocean is the right way to go; Perhaps there exists an awesome tool out there that I was not yet aware of;  I 
even thought about using Meteor, as I have a bit of experience through a software engineering course, but I soon realized 
that was like bringing a semi-truck to carry a bag of groceries. The interesting part to answering these types of 
questions was that, yes the project was mine to work on, but the result of the project was not.  Therefore a diligence 
for communication grew out of this fact.

Working through this project was a very rewarding endeavour, both in gaining experience through drawing out plans with
a client, as well as in discovering the subtle complexities in deploying a self-contained web-app with the only cost
being the initial purchase price for the domain name!  I managed to achieve this feat by an awesome and powerful tool
known as Netlify (shout out!).  Netlify does its magic by using an O-auth into your github and deploying straight from
your repo! This required a little bit of tricky DNS configuration to get the domain to point to the right location,
as well as getting the email correctly re-routed to the correct server, but  In the end everything works like a dream! 
The project turned out great and I had a lot of fun doing it.  Thank you and goodnight.
