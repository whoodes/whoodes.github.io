During the creation of the UH Bazaar application, my role existed as lead developer.  This was a welcomed burden, as the 
dynamics within our team naturally resulted in this outcome.  I helped delegate tasks to meet deadlines, assisted team 
members with debugging to the best of my ability, performed code review prior to deployment, along with the task of 
deploying the current version of the application corresponding to all three milestones.  I also assisted team members 
with git related issues.

Within the application itself, I was responsible for user related functionality:

- create user
- distinguish profile ownership 
- edit profile option 
- show users with view options 
- rate user
- integrating the *Items* and *Users* collections for use on the client side.

I was also responsible for item functionality: 

- create item 
- remove item 
- search item
- make item offer

For data hosting, with both user profile and item images, I integrated the UH Bazaar application with Amazon Web Services
using an S3 bucket.  This allows users to upload their images instead of being restricted to only using urls.  Succeeding 
in this task was a very educational and rewarding experience.

### Personal side goals

I generated a Google API key for UH Bazaar to integrate with Google Maps as an added functionality.
A branch exists with a map mock-up without functionality. I plan to implement this feature in the near future.  I view this
goal as an excellent learning opportunity regarding Google integration.  Like any piece of software, UH Bazaar will never
truly be complete.  As such, I plan to hone my javascript skills further by making incremental improvements to the application
in my spare time.

### As a result

Throughout this project, I have grown as a software developer.  I have accomplished goals I would have thought impossible 
just a year ago.  The accomplishments I achieved during the few weeks spent on UH Bazaar bolstered my exuberance in terms
of what I have to look forward to by becoming a computer scientist.  As a result, I excitedly await my next challenge.
