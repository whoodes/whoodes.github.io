For my internship at HawaiiUSA FCU I worked as a Technical Solutions Analyst on the Applications team within the IT department.  The first half of my project was done using the PowerOn programming language which is proprietary to Jack Henry & Associates.  I wrote a search program that utilized 15 different criteria, from birth date to VIN number, searching the entire database in a time efficient manner.  I worked side by side with a mentor who reviewed pseudocode, answered questions, and explained each step of the process map.  The niche for this language exists for federal credit unions using Symitar, in which case it is rather limited.  Although, working on skills such as quickly and efficiently learning a new programming language is extremely useful in its own right.  PowerOn is based on [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I) by IBM.

The other half of my project consisted of learning SQL fundamentals through [CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/).  Afterward, I applied what I had learned to generate reports based on specific requests by a particular department.  One SQL script I wrote helped to save employees in the business units *twenty hours* of work per month.  Seeing the fruits of my labor so quickly in the work setting was a very exciting and rewarding experience.

The internship at HawaiiUSA FCU was a fun and rewarding learning experience.  I discovered more about my self as a future software engineer and the type of development I want to do in the future.  Although the banking world might not be the type of long-term work environment I want for myself, the experience and knowledge I gained was invaluable.  As a student, I often forget about the business side of writing software.  The time spent at HawaiiUSA helped to shed light on the intricate tie between writing code and doing business, for that I am humbled by the opportunity I had there.
