<p>I am currently a third year computer science student pursuing my bachelor
of science degree.  Before this journey began, I took some time off from school to 
travel and discover my passions. I came to a crescendo of realization: a rekindled 
love for mathematics was my segway into the wonderful world of computer science.  
I'm glad that I took the time off from school to grow as an individual.  I have
confidence in my career choice, confidence accompanied by the fact that the 
disciplines of computer science both captivate my imagination and challenge my 
thinking.  As a result: Excitement!</p>
<p>When I am not speding my time coding / hacking / thinking about coding | hacking, 
I am eithher surfing or spending time with my family.  Maybe even surfing with my
family (win-win).  I live on the beautiful island of Oahu, but despite its beauty
my final destination is the mainland of the US.  The reasoning behind this is 
both school (master's program) and opportunities (good surf, no jobs).  As a human 
being, I strive to be passionate, dedicated and kind.  Thanks for stopping by!</p>
